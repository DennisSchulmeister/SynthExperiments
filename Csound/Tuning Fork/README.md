[Demos here on Github](Demos/)

This is just a very, very basic MIDI synthesizer that plays a sine wave with
fixed amplitude envelope when MIDI events are received. There is also a small
UI to play the synthesizer on screen. It simply serves as a project template
and test bed for the Csound language bindings on Android.
