The most pedestrian MIDI synthesizer you could build. Simply plays a sine wave
with a simple amplitude envelope when a key is pressed. At least there is a
button (bang) with a fixed frequency on screen as well as the possibility to
play any note vie MIDI channel 1. Serves as a test bed for `libpd` in a custom
built Android app, as it is described in the book "Making Musical App" from
PD core developer Peter Brinkmann, 2014. Here I want to find out, if and how
the integration needs to be adapted for Android Studio (when the book was written,
Android apps were still developed in Eclipse) and more recent SDK versions.
