Future Archive of Experimental Software Synthesizers
====================================================

(Zukunftsarchiv experimenteller Software-Synthesizer)

TODO: Rewrite README

This project is mainly a playground for me to learn audio DSP programming and
especially to implement synthesizers that can actually be used in a modern
music production or live set up of a typical keyboard player.

Additionally it is a research project to evaluate the modern Android ecosystem
(as of 2024) for real-time audio usage. Theoretically we can easily shrink the
the custom hardware of the Synclavier into a hand-held device, using a purely
software implementation of all the DSP. Apple devices are very good at this.
But how about the Android ecosystem? In theory the architectural problems have
finally been solved since a few years (much too late, actually). But the Android
ecosystem is very fragmented, so that we cannot really know the current state
unless we try out concrete examples on concrete devices.

Since both Csound and Pure Data offer bindings for Android applications,
this project also compares how both of them can be used in a real-world
project with demanding real-time requirements.
